# Blankplate

## Yet another HTML5/CSS3 Starter Kit
This is an alternative solution to save you time in frontend developing.

[Check out the demo][1]

## How this will help you

This package provides you with all you need to start building your web page quickly, still keeping an organized structure and a consistently stylesheet.

In short, this package contains a batch of reset and basic css rules, useful helpers etc; anything but annoying rules for grids or with strange paddings and margins.

## A quick and dirty example

Need three navigation menus one horizontal for your global menu, one vertical for your side section and another horizontal in the footer section.
You do not have to create extra rules and mess with display or float properties, just apply
`.horizontal` or `.vertical` class to your ul element and thatâ€™s it, now you are free to append your actual "styling" properties.

## What it does

It resets and redefines in a more rational way your html elements, offers you a collection of helpers, informs you on empty html elements and atributes, provides you with a basic folder/file/coding structure.

## What it doesn't

It does not interfere with your design, basically there are not predefine colors, paddings, margings or other dimensions. Consider Blankplate as a chassis for your project.
